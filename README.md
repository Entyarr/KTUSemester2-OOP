# KTUSemester2-OOP
 KTU Spring Semester C# Object Oriented Programming

 Here are all my projects for 2nd Semester in KTU
 For every program, my project number was 9.
 Feel free to use this code.

 I got maximum marks for all these programs,
 but keep in mind, your lecturer may have different requirements.

 Keep in mind, Lab2 and Lab3 are the same project
 that is meant to be completed with different requirements
